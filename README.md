Predictive models for survivability and adverse drug reactions

Abstract: We provide a risk level prediction tool based on data-driven approaches for patients suffering from breast cancer. A risk-level predictive model using classification models on public databases including the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) and Drugbank has been trained and evaluated. The proposed risk-level predictive framework includes multiple predictive models on each FAERS outcome such as death, hospitalization, life-threatening, disability, congenital anomaly, and other serious outcomes. Based on the trained models, a recommender system has been developed to recommend drug(s) with the least risk level based on the patientâ€™s gender, age, and weight. In addition, we have recently established another predictive model to find adverse drug reactions using extracted features from the Drugbank database such as drug target and drug pathway.
